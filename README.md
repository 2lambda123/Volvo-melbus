# Volvo MELBUS

This branch is about displaying custom text on the HU display. If you want to see how to build the hardware, go to the master branch.

Thanks to VincentGijsen for helping.

There is four text lines that can be cycled by pressing RND (on HU650). Edit the arduino code to put whatever you like there. Perhaps pulling song title and such from the BT module. (I haven't done that yet. I don't even know if my BT module is capable)
