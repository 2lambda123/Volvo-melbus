# Volvo MELBUS

Get AUX input on your Volvo stereo HU.

Needed:
* Arduino Nano 5V
* Transistor that can handle more than 0,5A
* 4 resistors:
   * 3x 100Ω
   * 1x 1KΩ
* A rectifier diode (> 0,5A)
* Cables
* Male DIN plug, 8 pin, 270 degrees

Some knowledge of electronics. You are responsible if things break! Not me!

This project shows the way I did it. Proceed at your own risk. I nearly blew the BT module and the arduino by switching the 12v RUN cable with the 5v BUSY cable...
